(WIP)

Last year I made a video called Technologies I'm Learning in 2021.
I want to review the technologies I said I learned and see how I actually did and then tell you guys what I'm planning on learning in 2022.

Relay, the GraphQL client that is made by facebook.
That's supposed to be awesome **beast mode**.
Everyone's telling me to try it out and I never got to it and I just kind of don't have a good excuse other than I didn't feel like it.
I'm relatively happy with the GraphQL client that I'm using now, Urql, so I would just continue to use that.
Should I give relay a try? Yes
Will it happen this year? To be honest probably not, but maybe, possibly.
I did indeed try OVH I bought a VPS from them and it was great, but unfortunately, I bought it right when they had a fire.
It went down and I was like well **snap** that's not good and switched to Google Cloud.

Oh Elixir, I had a lot of fun with you in 2021.
I built an entire clubhouse clone backend using it.
It worked wonderfully like 95 of the time and I loved the language but I also died inside having to code with a dynamically typed language and that is the reason why I am not coding Elixir currently.
I still really like it. I'll probably do some Elixir microservice things, like real time, decentralized, that's not the right word, concurrent, something where you have lots of processes happening at once Elixir is great at. I really liked it and would happily do
more of it.

Rust never really happened. I was gonna do some smart contract stuff with Solana and I did **dabble my two** a little bit in, but then I lost interest in Solana smart contracts and I was like yeah I don't really feel like learning Rust anymore.
I'll probably get to Rust eventually, but here's the thing I just really don't have a good use case to learn it right now, but when I have one then I'm gonna learn Rust, but it's just not there yet.

Cloudflare is great I stick in front of everything. That's pretty much it.

Rest APIs were created by me in 2021, but what I ended up doing was just trying to recreate my experience in GraphQL and generate types and do all that fun stuff and I realized that was dumb and so I just switched back to doing GraphQL APIs.

I never created a component library just not really feeling it.

I tried really hard to do a hardware project and I thought of a really cool idea and I tried in my brain to figure out what I would actually do to make this happen and I could figure out the sequence of logic, but then mapping that to the actual hardware parts I'd have to buy and wiring it all up, was just something I could not be bothered to do.There's just not as many resources on hardware as there is the software and it's like the cost of like trial and error is way more expensive.
Not even from a monetary point of view but your time of like waiting for parts to arrive trialing to see if the part works and if it didn't and it just never happened.
I do want to give it more tries in 2022 because there's still like a really cool thing I want to build.
I just need to have the willpower to want to try making it again which I lost.

Now I want to talk about some technologies that I used a lot in 2021.
I mentioned Chakra in my last video and how I like to use it to style React components.
I'm not using that anymore.
Tailwind is my go-to thing for styling absolutely everything.
It is amazing for productivity and I highly recommend it.

For GraphQL clients I am fully on the Urql train right now.
I don't really need the extra features that Apollo has and I feel like it's just getting a
little clunky.

Front frameworks still on React still like it and that's pretty much what I'm using for everything.

TypeScript's my go-to language for just full stack.
I like using it with Node.
I like using it on the front end.
It's great I really like the language.
It's statically typed which is big for me and I'm using it more than Elixir because of that, though I still see myself using some Elixir for certain things.

Database PostgreSQL, pretty standard, fantastic, use it for everything.

I started using prisma 2 with postgres sql
I still don't like that it does like way
too many queries if I tilt to update and
return fields it's not very optimized
but other than that the ux experience
for development is very good I really
like it React native is what I'm using
to build all apps not going back to
native development and not using flutter
vs code with vim key bindings is the
editor I'm using I did see jetbrains
create like a vs code like editor and i
might try that at some point but to be
honest I have zero complaints vs code
right now aws has become the cloud that
I use most but there's not really good
reason behind that and lastly this is
not really something I used a lot in
2021 but I did learn how to do smart
contracts with solidity and
it's kind of gross because it just
reminds me a lot of java but it is a
thing I did for 2022 the first thing I'd
like to do is learn more animation
things if you've seen my previous
projects you may see the lack of
animations that's because I just never
was really comfortable with them and i
didn't know how to animate or what i
wanted to animate but now when I'm doing
a void pet I kind of like sticking
animations in places and so I'm going to
do more stuff related to animations next
this is a possibility it's not like
confirmed it's not a hundred percent but
I might do some unity slash some 3d game
dev it may not actually be with unity
because I'm kind of enjoying building a
game right now void pet is specifically
going to be a web game for a while so it
may not need this
but there may be a point where I want to
now for some reason I'm kind of in the
mood to learn terraform and kubernetes
and do like some fancy devops things i
don't really have a good reason for you
on this one other than I just kind of
been in the mood for whatever reason
turbo repo is something I think is going
to be really easy to learn and it's just
going to speed up my yarn workspaces and
I just need to learn it and plug it into
my things it probably is going to take
like 10 minutes too remix is a React
framework that is kind of a competitor
to next.js I'm going to be watching this
and probably trying it out sometime this
year I'm excited to see nexus actually
have a competitor because they really
are competing against no one right now
so that's just gonna make the web dev
environment better for everyone
lastly we got smart contracts
this is a very big maybe I don't
actually know if this is gonna happen
I just
can't see myself not dabbling in them
somewhere but it may not be a deep thing
every time I've done smart contracts
I've kind of lost interest halfway
through but it may happen
who knows
there you go those are my plans for 2022
let me know in the comments below what
you're planning on learning or if you
have any recommendations for me I'm
always happy to hear them
you
