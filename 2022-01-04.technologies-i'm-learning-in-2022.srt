00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,260
Last year I made a video called technologies I'm learning in 2021.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:06,941
I want to review the technologies I said I learned.

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:12,569
And see how I actually did and then tell you guys what I'm planning on learning in 2022.

4
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,444
Relay, the GraphQL client that is made by Facebook.

5
00:00:15,644 --> 00:00:17,279
That's supposed to be awesome beast mode.

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,821
Everyone's telling me to try it out and I never got to it.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,862
And I just kind of don't have a good excuse other than I didn't feel like it.

8
00:00:25,062 --> 00:00:31,526
And I'm relatively happy with the GraphQL client that I'm using now Urql, so I would just continue to use that.

9
00:00:31,726 --> 00:00:35,360
Should I give Relay a try? Yes.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,960
Will it happen this year? To be honest, probably not but maybe,  possibly.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,840
I did indeed try OVH I bought a VPS from them and it was great. But unfortunately, I bought it right when they had a fire.

12
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,174
And it went down and I was like, well snap, that's not good and I switched to Google Cloud.

13
00:00:53,374 --> 00:00:56,301
Oh Elixir, I had a lot of fun with you in 2021.

14
00:00:56,501 --> 00:01:00,925
I built an entire clubhouse clone backend using it.

15
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:06,174
It worked wonderfully like 95 of the time and I loved the language.

16
00:01:06,374 --> 00:01:12,341
But I also died inside having to code with a dynamically typed language and that is the reason

17
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:14,880
why I am not coding an Elixir currently.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,901
I still really like it I'll probably do some Elixir microservice things because,  like real time, decentralized,

19
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:26,479
that's not the right word, concurrent, something where you have lots of processes happening at once, Elixir is great at.

20
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,953
I really liked it and would happily do more of it.

21
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:30,240
Rust never really happened.

22
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,885
I was gonna do some smart contract stuff with Solana.

23
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:38,560
And I did dabble my two a little bit in but then I lost interest in Solana smart contracts and I was like

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,342
yeah I don't really feel like learning Rust anymore. I'll probably get to Rust eventually, but here's the thing

25
00:01:43,542 --> 00:01:47,953
I just really don't have a good use case to learn it right now but when I have one then I'm gonna learn Rust.

26
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:49,491
But it's just not there yet.

27
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:52,960
Cloudflare is great I stick in front of everything that's pretty much it.

28
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:58,941
Rest apis were created by me in 2021 but what I ended up doing was just trying to recreate my experience in GraphQL

29
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:02,199
and generate types and do all that fun stuff and I realized that was dumb.

30
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,622
And so I just switched back to doing GraphQL apis.

31
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:07,280
I never created a component library just not really

32
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,608
feeling it I tried really hard to do a hardware project and

33
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:12,400
I thought of a really cool idea and I tried in my brain

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,720
to figure out what I would actually do

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,959
to make this happen and I could figure

36
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,200
out the sequence of logic but then

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
mapping that to the actual hardware

38
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,557
parts I'd have to buy and wiring it all up

39
00:02:23,757 --> 00:02:25,599
was just something I could not be

40
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,920
bothered to do there's just not as many

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,760
resources on hardware as there is the

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
software and it's like the cost of like

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,879
trial and error is way more expensive

44
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,640
not even from a monetary point of view

45
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,560
but your time of like waiting for parts

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,959
to arrive trialing to see if the part

47
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,720
works and if it didn't

48
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,800
and ugh it just yeah it just never happened.

49
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,879
I do want to give it more tries in 2022 because

50
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,183
there's still like a really cool thing I want to build

51
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:55,040
I just need to have the willpower to want to try making

52
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
it again which I lost.

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,319
Now I want to talk about some

54
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,879
technologies that I used a lot in 2021

55
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,040
I mentioned Chakra in my last video and

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,720
how I like to use it to style React

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,040
components I'm not using that anymore

58
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
Tailwind is my go-to thing for styling

59
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,440
absolutely everything it is amazing for

60
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,840
productivity and I highly recommend it.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,760
For GraphQL clients I am fully on the

62
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,599
Urql train right now I don't really

63
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
need the extra features that Apollo has

64
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,599
and I feel like it's just getting a little clunky.

65
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,873
Front frameworks still on React still like it

66
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,799
and that's pretty much what I'm using for everything.

67
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,720
TypeScript's my go-to language for just

68
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
full stack I like using it with node

69
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,731
I like using it on the front end it's great

70
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:36,253
I really like the language it's statically typed which is big for me

71
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,159
and I'm using it more than Elixir because of

72
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,400
that though I still see myself using

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,640
some Elixir for certain things.

74
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,599
Database PostgreSQL pretty standard fantastic use it for everything

75
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,480
I started using Prisma 2 with PostgreSQL

76
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,185
I still don't like that it does like way too many queries

77
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:56,664
if I tilt to update and return fields

78
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,080
it's not very optimized

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,004
but other than that the UX experience for development is very good

80
00:04:02,204 --> 00:04:04,560
I really like it. React Native is what I'm using

81
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,239
to build all apps not going back to

82
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,400
native development and not using Flutter.

83
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,285
VSCode with Vim key bindings is the editor I'm using.

84
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:15,238
I did see Jetbrains create like a VSCode-like editor

85
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,091
and I might try that at some point but to be honest

86
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,487
I have zero complaints VSCode right now.

87
00:04:20,687 --> 00:04:22,569
Aws has become the cloud that I use most

88
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:24,816
but there's not really good reason behind that.

89
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:27,684
And lastly, this is not really something I used a lot in 2021

90
00:04:27,884 --> 00:04:32,091
but I did learn how to do smart contracts with solidity

91
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,904
and it's kind of gross because it just reminds me a lot of Java

92
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:37,609
but it is a thing I did. For 2022, the first thing

93
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:40,005
I'd like to do is learn more animation things.

94
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:43,521
If you've seen my previous projects you may see the lack of animations

95
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:46,489
that's because I just never was really comfortable with them

96
00:04:46,689 --> 00:04:49,052
and I didn't know how to animate or what I wanted to animate

97
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:52,000
but now when I'm doing a voidpet, I kind of like sticking

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,410
animations in places and so I'm going to do more stuff related to animations.

99
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,279
Next this is a possibility it's not like confirmed

100
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:00,935
it's not a hundred percent

101
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,120
but I might do some Unity / 3d game dev.

102
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,840
It may not actually be with unity,

103
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,830
because I'm kind of enjoying building a game right now.

104
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:13,520
Voidpet is specifically going to be a web game for a while, so it may not need this.

105
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,680
But there may be a point where I want to.

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
Now for some reason I'm kind of in the mood to learn Terraform and Kubernetes.

107
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
And do like some fancy DevOps things.

108
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,880
I don't really have a good reason for you on this one other than I just kind of been in the mood for whatever reason.

109
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,894
Turborepo is something I think is going to be really easy to learn.

110
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:33,759
And it's just going to speed up my Yarn workspaces and

111
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,139
I just need to learn it and plug it into my things it probably is going to take like 10 minutes too.

112
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,633
Remix is a React framework that is kind of a competitor to Next.js

113
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:49,365
I'm going to be watching this and probably trying it out sometime this year. I'm excited to see Next.js actually have a competitor

114
00:05:49,565 --> 00:05:52,240
because they really are competing against no one right now

115
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,759
so that's just gonna make the web dev environment better for everyone.

116
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,449
Lastly we got smart contracts, this is a very big maybe

117
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,840
I don't actually know if this is gonna happen

118
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,840
I just can't see myself not dabbling in them somewhere, but it may not be a deep thing.

119
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,931
Every time I've done smart contracts, I've kind of lost interest halfway through.

120
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,199
But it may happen, who knows?

121
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,440
There you go, those are my plans for 2022.

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,049
Let me know in the comments below what you're planning on learning.

123
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:25,960
Or if you have any recommendations for me I'm always happy to hear them.
